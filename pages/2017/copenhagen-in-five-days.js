    <h1>Copenhagen in Five Days</h1>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/nyhavn1.jpg" />
    <p>
      In April of 2017, I spent five days exploring Copenhagen. I'd like to write about that trip to better preserve my memories while also helping other travellers plan their own adventure. While researching Copenhagen I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the options. I think my experience and schedule can give other travelers better sense of what to expect. Before I get in to my day-by-day recap, I want to talk about a few other miscellaneous aspects of the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flight:</b>
      {' '}
      I managed to score a round-trip flight from St. Louis to Copenhagen for $460 through
      {' '}
      <a target="_blank" href="flights.google.com">Google Flights</a>
      . I'm not totally sure how that great of a deal happened. I
      {' '}
      <i>can</i>
      {' '}
      tell you that for at least a day or so in December of 2016, flights for one-week trips to Europe in April were very, very cheap. My best advice here is to frequently check for deals while maintaining a flexible schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Boarding:</b> I booked a
      {' '}
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Airbnb.com/rooms/15060832">
        really great Airbnb with an amazing host
      </a>
      . It was located in the center of Copenhagen which made walking to everything super easy. I walked so much, though, that I don't think you should shy away from deals in other parts of the city. Copenhagen is very bike-friendly, too. There are free bike shares around the city along with dedicated lanes everywhere you want to go. Personally, I didn't bike much. The lanes were pretty fast and I didn't want to stop traffic when I looked at my phone for directions. You may be more confident than me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Money:</b>
      {' '}
      Have a money plan. You'll probably want to use a credit card throughout your trip, particularly if you have one with no international fee. Unfortunately, I realized too late that I didn't know the pin for my low-fee card, so I wouldn't be able to use it in most places of Copenhagen. Request your pin in advance from your bank if you're not sure what yours is. I ended up withdrawing Danish krones from the ATM and that worked out fine despite feeling like the only one in the whole country holding cash. Also, be sure you understand the conversion rate. I accidentally took out 10 times as much money from the ATM because I wasn't careful about it. During my trip is was roughly 1USD to 7DKK.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Public Transportation:</b>
      {' '}
      The public transit in Denmark is both confusing & great. It works on a weird "zone" system, but you can largely ignore that by either purchasing tickets to an entered destination or by grabbing a time-based pass when you know you'll be using the the transit a lot (like when traveling outside the city). I'd also recommend you look into the
      {' '}
      <a href="http://www.copenhagencard.com/whats-included" target="_blank">
        Copenhagen Card
      </a>
      . I didn't realize this was a thing until a few days into my trip but it covers all transit costs in addition to some museum admission fees. It might be a good purchase for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Opening Hours:</b>
      {' '}
      In general, the museums and attractions in Copenhagen tend to only be open from 10 to 4. And nothing is open on Monday. These restrictions surprised me a few times and should be considered when planning your own trip.
    </p>
    <h3>Day 1: Friday — The Battle Against Sleep</h3>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/day1.png">Day 1 Walking Route</Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Airbnb (A):</b>
      {' '}
      I felt the affects of jetlag starting to kick in as I arrived at about 12:50PM on Friday. After meeting with my host and dropping my stuff off, my entire goal was to stay awake long enough to fall into a relatively normal sleeping pattern over the next couple of days. I wanted to get walking almost immediately so this night ended up being the least "planned" of my stay. I was actually a bit surprised by how productive I was this night.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/window.jpg">

    <p>
      <b>Shoreline & The Little Mermaid (B & C):</b>
      {' '}
      I wanted to see the water so I walked directlly east from the Airbnb. According to a quick glance of Google Maps, there were obvious tourist attractions to the north so I decided to generally head that way. I was surprised by just how cold it was. Definitely remember to bring some layers and a thick jacket that will be comfortable in the wind if you come in a similar season. The Little Mermaid is a small statue. I don't know why it's such a big deal. I do know that the Danes love their Hans Christian Andersen.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/mermaid.jpg">
      The Little Mermaid statue is one of those landmarks that is only famous because it is famous. Much like a Kardashian. Also, this viking guy was really nice.
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Kastellet (D):</b>
      {' '}
      "The Citadel" is a preserved star fortress along the coast of Copenhagen. Definitely a cool thing to see but not something you'd spend very much time at. St. Alban's Church and Gefion Fountain are also here, just south of the outer wall.
    </p>

    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Danish Museum of Art & Design (E):</b>
      {' '}
      Once I had enough of the citadel, I started to head south and figured I could knock out a museum. This one was relatively small and I really liked the exhibits. The ticket was 100DKK (or free if under 26). It was They also had a dope public restroom.

      <b>Frederik's Church (F):</b>
      {' '}
      I was drawn to this place by the dome. The inside is very pretty and you can enter for free.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/frederik.jpg" />
    <p>
      <b>Restaurant Puk (G):</b>
      {' '}
      I thought I would end my first night in Copenhagen by diving straight into Danish food. This restaurant was relatively close by and had decent reviews on Google Maps. This was definitely the kind of place that operated primarily off of reservations, so I was happy that they had room for me when I approached the hostess. I had a smoked salmon starter and the roast pork for my main dish. It was fine food and a fine restaurant, but I didn't find traditional Danish food to be anything special. I don't really prioritize food & drink when I travel so your experience may be different.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/beef.jpg">
      I almost fell asleep in my Roast Pork. I crashed immediately after this.

    <h3>Day 2: Saturday — Museums & Roller Coasters</h3>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/day2.png">Day 2 Walking Route</Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Kongen's Have (B):</b>
      {' '}
      The King's Garden was where I waited for Rosenborg to open. I ate a bagel from the nearby Bagel Co. and finished a book. There was a family here hiding easter eggs and that was fun to see.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/garden.jpg">
      Secret X-Men hideout, too
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Rosenborg Slot (C):</b>
      {' '}
      Rosenborg Castle stood out to me from the other historical museums thanks to it's small size. Each room had it's own purpose within the building. And getting to see the Crown Jewels in the basement was pretty cool. Also, I was pretty into the guidebook they hand you at the begining. That's kind of a lame thing to enjoy, but the way they mapped out each floor on a seperate page was really satisfying.
    </p>

      Totally going to design a D&D adventure around this place.

    <p>
      <b>Rundetaarn (D):</b>
      {' '}
      I stumbled on the Round Tower while looking for a lunch venue. The tower is really unique and the view at the top is one of the best of downtown Copenhagen.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/roundtower.jpg">
      I'm pretty sure I've seen a movie scene set here or something...
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Statens Museum for Kunst (E):</b>
      {' '}
      The National Gallery of Denmark was a nice modern museum. The art is displayed in chronological order and is seperated by country of origin.
    </p>

      <b>Nap Time (F):</b> Gotta get your rest before you coaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Strøget (G):</b>
      {' '}
      Strøget is a pedestrian, car free shopping area in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's one of the most busy areas and a really great place to explore, particularly if you're into shopping.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/sven.jpg">
      This guy, "Sven from Sweden", was performing on the street several times as I walked past. It was a master class in working a crowd.

    <p>
      <b>Tivoli (H):</b>
      {' '}
      The final destination of my night was this amusement park. I'm pretty sure the ticket booth stiffed me out of some change, but I enjoyed walking around the park and playing some games. When it got dark I rode a couple roller coasters. If you ride more than 2-3 rides I would suggest purchasing the unlimited rides pass. The steel roller coaster was short but really fun. I got a great photo of myself on the ride.
    </p>

    <h3>Day 3: Sunday — Canal Tour & Stuff</h3>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/day3.png">Day 3 Walking Route</Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Nyvahn & Canal Tour (B):</b>
      {' '}
      This is one of the most iconic areas of Copenhagen, and for good reason. It's a really unique area with a very energetic vibe. You can hope on a boat here at the tip of the canal for a one-hour tour that covers all the waterfront areas of Copenhagen. I definitely recommend it. There are also bus tours, but I think you can see the city without them. The "hop-on hop-off" stuff seemed overly restrictive for the amount of time you would invest.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/nyhavn2.jpg">
      Nyhavn was my favorite place to read while waiting for the city to wake up. The pedestrian bridge to the southeast of the canal was also a great place to relax.
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Amalieborg (C):</b>
      {' '}
      I wasn't that impressed with the inside of this place. Definitely walk through the area here to see the exterior but I would only go inside this one if you were interested in more modern Danish history and artifacts.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/amalieborg.jpg">
      The gaurds yelled at people several times while they were waiting too close to the wall for the museum to open up. It was funny to see them break their march.
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Vor Frelsers Kirke (D):</b>
      {' '}
      The Church of Our Saviour is a great place to get a view over the area of Christiania. Make sure not to get here too late, though. If it's a really nice day the line is out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pusher Street (E):</b>
      {' '}
      Freetown Christiania is a self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood. It was mostly known to me as the place to buy weed in Copenhagen. You'll notice I lack photos of this place. That's because there are signs that strictly prohibit it and the dudes at the various stands did not seem very friendly. Definitely a fascinating place to walk through. I think there are places of the neighborhood that I probably missed, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Copenhagen Street Food (F):</b>
      {' '}
      One of my favorite destinations of the trip. Basically a warehouse on the waterfront with about twenty street food and alcohol vendors. I bought some tacos and a beer before reading by the water.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/streetfood.jpg">
      It was a really great day in April so this place was packed.

    <h3>Day 4: Monday — Everything is Closed</h3>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/day4.png">Day 4 Walking Route</Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Christiansborg (B):</b>
      {' '}
      So this is pretty much a whole area of destinations I missed out on. My goal this morning was to rest and do some work at the Black Diamond, but I took the time to walk around this area as well. I definitely would have checked out the military history museum if it weren't

      .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Black Diamond (C):</b>
      {' '}
      The royal library was very cool. And open on Mondays! I got a good look at the outside of it on the canal tour so I came here for a few hours in the morning to get some work done. I got to overhear some Danish students hang out and work on their schoolwork and that was pretty entertaining.
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/diamond.jpg">
      Pretty neat architecture!
    </Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Torvehallerne (D):</b>
      {' '}
      This was a market near Norreport, one of the biggest public transit stations. It has a lot of grocery stalls and is a decent place to stop for a bite to eat. Mostly, this was just a northern destination to give me an excuse to leisurely walk through Strøget again.

      Zzz...

      was holding an international festival and it started on this night. I bought a ticket and watched for a couple hours as teams from various other countries performed in English. It was funny! And kind of fascinating to see people from so many countries do improv.
    </p>
    <h3>Day 5: Tuesday — What About Sweden?</h3>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/day5.png">Day 5 Walking Route</Figure>
    <p>
      <b>Helsingør (B):</b>
      {' '}
      This is where Kronborg Castle, the setting for Shakespeare's "Hamlet", is. It seems to be a frequent day trip destination for people visiting Copenhagen. I purchased a 24-hour transit pass from Norreport that covered this whole excursion. The castle was definitely worth seeing. There are short guided tours in English if you get there when it opens. I didn't explore the city much but it seemed pretty friendly.

    <p>
      <b>Helsingborg (C):</b>
      {' '}
      The simplest way to get to Sweden from Denmark is the ferry out of Helsingør. It's a really short ferry trip and cheap, too. I could have explored Helsingborg more than I did but honestly I was getting pretty pooped at this point. I did visit the medieval Kärnan tower and that was a quick way to get a good view of Helsingborg.

      <b>Louisiana Museum of Modern Art</b>
      {' '}
      A short walk from the train station, this had a few really large exhibits of different modern artists. Lots of interactive and huge-scale walkthroughs of varying media made by and about the artists. It had a really interesting outdoor section and the kitchen offered some large buffet meals.

    <h3>Day 6: Wednesday - Flying Home</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The Union Kitchen:</b>
      {' '}
      This was the last restaurant I went to in Copenhagen before leaving, and it was one of my favorites. A very hipster interior. Good for brunch!
    </p>
    <Figure src="/static/img/cph/waffle.jpg">
      Chicken & Waffles were awesome. With a side of meatballs cause why not?

      In closing, I had a really great time. I feel like I succeeded in seeing all that the city had to offer while soaking up some Danish culture.
